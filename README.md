# Courses Timeline Sheet

The purpose of this Excel sheet is to plot your courses on a timeline. This would make it clearer for you to see how many courses are running in parallel, or occurring at a particular time in the future. I have found this tool very useful while taking several Online courses on Coursera. It helped me estimate the work load and plan when to take the courses I am targeting. The sheet is tuned to Coursera courses but you can generalize it other courses and projects.

## Elements of the Sheet

The sheet consists of two sections: A table and a chart.

### The Table

- Each row in the table represents a course.
- Each column represent a property of that course (e.g. when it starts, when it ends, etc.).
- Yellow cells (columns) are calculations. You don't need to put values in them manually. The values will be automatically calculated.

### The Chart

- The timeline (horizontal axis) is divided into weeks. 
- The vertical axis represent the span of each course. So each horizontal bar represents where a specific course starts and where it ends.
- The red portion of the bar represents the past (before the current date) and the black portion of the bar represents the future.

## How to Use This sheet

You may simple use this sheet as is, or modify it. Here is some suggestions for each scenario. 

### Basic Use

- Fill in your courses instead of the provided examples. 
- Use the automatic filtering and sorting options in the table and they'll reflect in the chart automatically.
- Modify the start and end date of the chart horizontal axis to fit your data.

### Modifications

- The most basic modification is to edit the course properties to your liking.  
- It would be awesome if you can pick one of the **future work** items listed below.
- In all cases, please abide with the license notice below.

## Future work

- Let the horizontal axis minimum and maximum values automatically adjust themselves to accommodate the data entered in the table.
- Put this sheet on Google Sheets, and make it public, so that all Coursera students can add to it.
- Let the width of the horizontal bar reflect the course work load.
- Automatically fill-in all Coursera courses from their website using a script.
- Adapt this sheet to other MOOCs, e.g. edx.org.
